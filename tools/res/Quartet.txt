We refer to the second level of the hierarchy of our spatial array as a "quartet". The four autonomous PEs are connected to one another as well as a small 2R1W data memory in this test system.

Each PE has the same performance counter and debug interface as in the PE test system and their behavior can still be monitored individually within the context of a cooperative workload.

In a version with a cache, we envision that each quartet would have its own very small L1 cache.
